# ON-RAMP payment API

In this documentation it is described how the integration with On-RAMP payment System should be done.
In this first section there is a general description of the Flow between an External System that wants to integrate with **On-RAMP's API** 

## Terminology and Acronyms 

- Client Service (CIS): The service using On-RAMP as payment processor
- User (USR): CIS's users.

## Suggested flow

### Ingress flow

- **CIS** dynamically generate an invoice for the **USR** calling the ON-RAMP endpoint [Create Ingress Invoice](#create-ingress-invoice).

  - These invoices can be cached, but once paid, they will become **invalid**.

  - If cached for too long, they'd became invalid. The expiration date for each invoice is specified as an argument when creating the invoice.

  - Invoices are ON-RAMP url for a specific **USR**; the same invoice should not be reused among different users.

- **CIS** shows the invoice to the **USR** as a link to click and/or QR to scan.

- On-RAMP process the payment. This could long anything between the instant the invoice is created to the expiration date is reached. For example, the **USR** could start the payment, stops in the middle, then resume next day.

- On-RAMP calls back the **CIS** to inform the payment had been successfully completed. This callback will include any reference included as a parameter when creating the invoice.

  - The **CIS** should return a 200ok after this callback.

  - If the **CIS** does not return a 200ok after the callback, the callback will be retried (with exponential decay** till the 200ok is returned until N tries has been reached where Nis a number to be agreed between **CIS** and ON-RAMP server.

- On-RAMP will inform the **USR** the payment was a success.

- On-RAMP will redirect the **USR** to the url specified as a parameter when the invoice was created; or it will redirect the user back to where it was if not specified.

### Egress flow

**Analogous to the ingress flow**

- The **CIS** dynamically creates an **egress-invoice** create\_egress\_invoice.

  - It is possible but not required for the **CIS** to cache this invoices.

  - Each withdrawal associated with one of these invoices would be executed at most once.

- The **CIS** shows the **USR** the invoice as a URL or QR.

- After the **USR** clicks/scan it.

- On-RAMP call backs the **CIS** to confirm the withdrawal.

  - As with the ingress callback, this callback will contain any specified when the invoice was created reference.

  - According to what the **CIS** returns:

    - 200ok with payload {success: true}. ON-RAMP considers the withdrawal confirm, and continue to send funds back to the **USR**. Then redirect the user back to where specified, or kept them on the ON-RAMP app if not specified.
    - 200ok with payload {success: false, redirect: <err-url\>}. ON-RAMP will consider the withdrawal cancel, the egress-invoice invalidated, and will redirect the **USR** to <err-url\> which could be a page where the **CIS** explains the reason it was cancel (i.e, temporally down, not enough funds \... etc).

    - Anything else: ON-RAMP will retry the callback with exponential decay.

## Questions

- What metadata will be offer to enhance the **USR** info about the payment? Such images, text description, links to click, etc...

- Extra requirement for us? Such queries about **USR**s, due balances or payment statuses?

- Allow **USR**s to ingress offline? (Meaning doing so directly through ON-RAMP, without the user interacting with the **CIS**).

- Allow **USR**s to egress offline?

## Suggested offline extension for ingress/egress

### Offline Ingress flow

- When **CIS** creates an online ingress-invoice, it will add the following parameters:

  - refresh\_invoice\_url: a callback to **CIS** with any require reference. If specified and not null, once the invoice is no longer valid (the **USR** already used it or it was timeout) ON-RAMP will call it to generate a new invoice.The expected return payload for this callback is the same as the payload the **CIS** would use to create a new invoice, and the result would be the same.

  - invoice\_display\_key: if set to null or not specified, the ingress-invoice won't be display on the **USR** ON-RAMP app. If set to something else, the ON-RAMP will display the invoice, allowing the user to click on it at any time to initiate an ingress without directly interacting with **CIS**. If the ON-RAMP app gets 2 invoices from the same **CIS** with the same invoice\_display\_key, the first one will be discarded (this is a mechanism such **CIS** is able to update the invoice, such changing its description**.

### Offline Egress flow

Similar to offline ingress, we'll add the parameters refresh\_invoice\_url and invoice\_display\_key to create\_egress\_invoice.

# API Reference

This API is built in REST API style. In this sense it has resource-oriented URLs, accepts [JSON](http://www.json.org/) request bodies, returns []JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

# Base URL 

**https://api.onramp.com**

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://api.onramp.io/create/invoice" -H "Authorization: Bearer AUTH_TOKEN"
```

> Make sure to replace `AUTH_TOKEN` with your API key.

On-RAMP uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](https://onramp.com/developers).

On-RAMP expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Bearer AUTH_TOKEN`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>AUTH_TOKEN</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

# Ingress API

## Create Ingress Invoice

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.onramp.com/ingress/invoice/create" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer AUTH_TOKEN"
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Fluffums",
    "breed": "calico",
    "fluffiness": 6,
    "cuteness": 7
  },

```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
let max = api.kittens.get(2);
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json

```

This endpoint retrieves a specific kitten.

<aside class="warning">Inside HTML code blocks like this one, you can't use Markdown, so use <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> blocks to denote code.</aside>
