### Response JSON Fields

| Field          | Type   | Description                                           |
| -------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| invoice_id     | String | Internal **ON/RAMP**'s Invoice Identifier.            |
| invoice_url    | Url    | Url where to redirect user.                           |
| invoice_url_qr | Url    | Source Url for an image with QR-encoded `invoice_url` |

### Verified vs Unverified traffic

**One of the most important things to be defined when communicating with the ON/RAMP API is if the traffic you are sending is verified or unverified.**

In order to let us know if that specific user you are sending us for a transaction has been KYC verified is to send a valid date on the `kyc_verified` parameter inside the `billing_details` object.

So the 2 potential cases are:

- Verified traffic

  - You need to send us the `kyc_verified` parameter with a valid date.

- Unverified traffic

  - You can either not send the `kyc_verified` parameter or send it with a `null` value.

### Callback Ingress Invoice

Once **ON/RAMP** is ready to commit the payment, it will call back merchant to confirm. **It is only at this point
when the user transaction should be consider done and credited at merchant's side**. If the merchant was able to
credit the user, then it should answer the callback with an http 200 status code; if the merchant was unable to
credit the user, it should answer with an http 204 status code (this will cancel the user payment, expiring his
invoice link). **Any other status code** but 200 or 204 **will be treated as an internal error from the merchant side**,
pausing the user payment and prompting manual intervention, potentially delaying the process several hours.

> IMPORTANT: This callback is going to be done with **HTTP POST** method and not with GET, either for `payment_ack_url` or `cancel_url`.

  }
}
```

### Confirmation request signature

If you are willing to impose additional security on final confirmation callback (the one specified under `payment_ack_url`) we can provide a unique secret which will be used to sign request in the following way:

- take prettified request body (see [RFC759](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7159))
- append as a new line random nonce provided under the header `x-xco-nonce`
- append as a new line given secret
- URI encode result
- apply SH512 hashing
- base64 encode result
- compare obtained string with the one provided under `xco-x-signature` header

> Example confirmation callback with signature header and steps to recreate it (please note that `x-xco-authorization` header will be sent anyway)

```shell
curl -X POST payment_ack_url \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'x-xco-authorization: Bearer 9d01c660-19e3-4070-a1f1-72a6e2b8bc94' \

### Bank payments flow

As a clarification, our ingress flow currently supports both paying with credit card and with our bank payments solution.

**In order to be able to use that, you need to get a specific API key from us.**

For how the flow works or what parameters are needed to be used, you can see above on the technical specifications how:

- Flow is exactly the same as in a 3DS transaction, but instead the user seeing an OTP screen to confirm the transaction, they will see a page where they will be able to choose from the available banks and continue the process.
- The parameters required are exactly the same as on the credit card payment, but except for the credit card data since this is a bank payment flow. This means the same current implementation you may have for credit card payment will work (even if for some reason you would be sending credit card details, as those would be ignored).
