# Crypto Ingress Flow

This documentation contains the main endpoints that participate in the Crypto Ingress Flow. Most of them are called directly from the **iframe**
integration that you can see [here](#crypto-iframe-integration).

From the User point of view, there are mainly 3 steps in the flow:

1. User requests a new Crypto Address (_BTC or BCH_) to transfer coins into.
2. Once we verify that the user has transferred coins to that address, we notify back to the Merchant that there are new funds available from this user.
3. On this notification, the Merchant should request to initiate a new Invoice as in other Payments Methods.

Steps **2 and 3** should be interactively between Merchant and ON/RAMP because of the nature of Blockchain transactions, since we need to wait to the user to transfer some coins but since the process is completely asynchronous and distributed, we dont know when the user is going to do the transfer and how much is going to transfer.

## User request a Crypto Address

As it is mentioned in [Crypto Iframe Integration](#crypto-iframe-integration), this is done by calling the endpoint in the **iframe** `get_address`. This is forwarding the call to the public endpoint:

> Example cURL

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "x-xco-authorization: Bearer MERCHANT_API_KEY" -d '{"merchant_customer_id": "123","fiat_amount": 10000, "fiat_currency": "EUR", "notify_new_funds_url": "http://mydomain.com/callback/notify/crypto_done" }' http://localhost:7000/blockchain/api/v1/btc/address/new

| ------ | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Header | `x-xco-authorization` | `Bearer merchant_api_key` |

### Parameters

| name  | type | values     | description                              |
| ----- | ---- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| chain | enum | `btc, bch` | Blockchain the user requested ingress to |

### Body

## ON/RAMP notify Merchant on new Crypto Funds

As we have seen in the previous endpoint the Merchant is going to provide some URL to notify back when there is some new funds from some user.

> **_IMPORTANT_**: This is not the same as `payment_ack_url` because up to this point we don't know how much money the user is going to transfer and if in fact the user is going to transfer or not. This SHOULD NOT be consider as an INVOICE.

When we are ready to do the callback notifying about new Crypto funds we are going to do the following call:

<aside class="success"><b><code>POST `notify_new_funds_url`</code></b></aside>

> Example cURL

```shell
curl -X POST 'http://mydomain.com/callback/notify/crypto_done' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'x-xco-authorization: Bearer MERCHANT_API_KEY' \
-d '{
    "crypto_tx_ref": "123",
    "high_risk": false
}'
```

> Request

```json
{
  "crypto_tx_ref": "REFERENCE_ID_TO_BE_USED_IN_CALLING_CREATE_CRYPTO_INGRESS_INVOICE",
  "high_risk": false
}
```

## Merchant Create new Crypto Invoice

Once the Merchant receives the notification on new crypto funds it should call the following endpoint to initiate the invoice. Similar to [Ingress API](#ingress-api).
The main difference with this endpoint is that it is provided the real amount of fiat that the user deposits at the moment that the crypto transaction was confirm. Because the end user cannot be forced to deposit a specific amount of crypto, we cannot rely on what the user input as fiat amount in the beginning of the transaction, because the user can deposit less or more in crypto and due to the variability of the price of this kind of assets.
